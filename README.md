# Update the Genetic Algorithm for solving real-valued optimization problems.
## Requirements:
- Prepare 3 real-valued test functions: Sphere, Schwefel and Rastrigin
- Prepare functions for encoding and decoding between binary string and decimal value (binary coded decimal - BCD)
- when decoding from binary, make sure that the resulting decimal value makes sense (1111 cannot be F, but 9 instead)

## Test the Genetic Algorithm on prepared test functions, settings:
- Dimension - 10
- Generations - 1000
- Population size - 20
- Elitism - 20%
- Mutation probability - 2%
- Decimal precision - 4 digits after the decimal point
- Show convergence graphs and basic descriptive statistics
